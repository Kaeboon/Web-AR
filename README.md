# Web-AR
This is a project done under Tel-imaginarium workshop.
It is a simple AR web application that can detects specific images and display a 3D model and text. In this case, it will scan an image of the top view of a steam hammer and dispay the full model with it's description, thus serving educational purposes. This app is built using the glitch.com platform. 

You may watch the final result here: [youtube](https://youtube.com/shorts/uRmyxC_ZY_o).

To try out the application yourself:
1) On your device browser, go to this [link](https://single-column-steam-hammer.glitch.me/)
2) Allow camera access and scan the picture below, or from this [link](https://github.com/Kaeboon/Web-AR/blob/main/Assets/Steam_Hammer_top_view.png). You should be able to see a 3D model appearing similar to the video.
